I wasn't comfortable with the html file that Nic sent out, so I started work in in MD. I left numbers in just to indicate what I was thinking of including on each slide. Clearly we'll need to move things around and modify them - and delete the numbers.

Classes: The New Sugar in JavaScript
------------------------------------

By Nicandro Flores, Megan Greening, and Brian McWilliams
========================================================

2
How did we get here?
====================

*ECMAScript is a specification for scripting languages
*TC39 is tasked with writing the new spec, called Harmony or ECMAScript 6 (ES6)
*Classes will be added in Harmony
* Programmers are divided on whether or not this is a good thing

3
The Prototypal Way
==================

*JS is object oriented, but it doesn't have Class syntax, as Java does
*Classes can be simulated in JS since objects are highly versatile
*"Prototype" is the property that allows programmers to simluate protoype-based classes

4
Code Example of Prototypes
==========================
*Some or all of the employee example? This might be two slides' worth.
